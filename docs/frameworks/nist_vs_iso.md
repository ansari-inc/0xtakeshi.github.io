# NIST vs. ISO: Know the key difference

**Cybersecurity frameworks** are the foundation of effective risk management. They help **you** protect sensitive data, maintain compliance, and build trust with stakeholders. The two most widely recognized are the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** and the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**.

While both frameworks offer structured approaches to managing cybersecurity risk, they differ in scope, applicability, and implementation. To choose the right framework for your organization, **you must understand** these differences.

According to a Perforce study, 54% of organizations experience data breaches because of **noncompliance**. Choosing the right framework and applying it consistently can help reduce this risk and strengthen your security posture.

## NIST and ISO frameworks

### NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)

NIST is a U.S. government agency that develops standards and best practices to improve cybersecurity for both federal and **private sector** organizations. Its frameworks are known for being detailed, prescriptive, and highly actionable.

**Common NIST frameworks:**

* **NIST 800-53:** Security and privacy controls for federal information systems.
* **NIST 800-171:** Protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in non-federal systems.
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):** A voluntary guide to help **you** assess and improve your cybersecurity programs.

Together, these frameworks form a comprehensive toolkit for managing cyber risk, whether **you operate** within the federal ecosystem or the private sector.

### ISO (International Organization for Standardization)

ISO develops globally recognized standards that provide a flexible, principle-based approach to information security. These frameworks focus on establishing repeatable, risk-based processes that **you can adapt** to any industry or geography.

**Key ISO standards:**

* **ISO 27001:** Establishes an Information Security Management System (ISMS).
* **ISO 27002:** Offers best practices for implementing security controls within an ISMS.

ISO standards are ideal for organizations seeking a consistent, globally accepted approach to cybersecurity governance.

## Key differences between NIST and ISO

Both frameworks aim to reduce cyber risk. **NIST focuses on detailed implementation, while ISO provides flexible, scalable standards.**

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and maturity model

The **NIST CSF** helps **you** identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats. It also includes a **maturity model** that defines the progression toward cybersecurity resilience:

* **Partial (Initial):** Reactive, ad hoc security practices.
* **Risk-Informed:** Some risk management processes established.
* **Repeatable:** Policies and controls are consistently applied.
* **Adaptive (Optimized):** Continuous improvement and proactive resilience.

Advancing through these maturity levels enables **you** to strengthen **your** security posture over time.

### Achieving NIST CSF alignment

To align with **NIST CSF**, **you should**:

* **Assess your current cybersecurity posture** to identify strengths and gaps.
* **Implement recommended controls**, applying NIST guidance across key functions.
* **Continuously monitor and improve** to maintain resilience as threats evolve.

## When to choose NIST vs. ISO

**Choose NIST if you:**

* Operate primarily in the U.S. or work with federal agencies.
* Require detailed, prescriptive security guidance.
* Handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) or other regulated data.

**Choose ISO if you:**

* Operate globally and need international recognition.
* Prefer a flexible, risk-based framework.
* Seek ISO 27001 certification for credibility with customers and partners.

Many organizations integrate both frameworks. They use NIST for technical rigor and ISO for global consistency.

## How Shared Assessments supports framework alignment

Managing multiple frameworks can be complex. Shared Assessments provides the tools and expertise to help **you** navigate compliance efficiently and confidently.

* **Standardized Information Gathering (SIG) Questionnaire:** The SIG maps to NIST, ISO, HIPAA, GDPR, and other leading standards, streamlining third-party risk assessments. Updated annually, it covers **21 critical risk domains**, ensuring comprehensive coverage of cybersecurity, compliance, and operational risk.
* **Guide to Risk Domains:** An essential resource outlining the 21 domains **you** must assess to maintain robust cybersecurity and compliance programs.
* **Certified Third Party Risk Professional (CTPRP) Certification:** The CTPRP helps risk professionals deepen their expertise in third-party risk management and stay current in an evolving regulatory landscape.
* **Collaborative Industry Thought Leadership:** Through our committees, working groups, and resources, Shared Assessments connects industry leaders to advance best practices in third-party risk management.
